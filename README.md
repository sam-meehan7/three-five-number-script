# ThreeFive Number Printer

## Description

Here we have two Python scripts that print numbers from a specified range. For multiples of three, they print "Three", for multiples of five, they print "Five", and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five, they print "ThreeFive". These scripts demonstrate different approaches in Python programming, featuring interactive command-line interfaces, exception handling, and some colouring you may find familiar ðŸ˜†

## Scripts

### Script 1: Simple ThreeFive Printer

- A straightforward script using basic conditional logic.
- Emphasises simplicity leaving little areas where things can go wrong.

##

### Script 2: Advanced ThreeFive Printer

- Making use of functional programming techniques and colored output in this script.
- Interactive CLI with user input validation.
- Offers helpful hints after repeated invalid inputs for user friendliness and usability.
